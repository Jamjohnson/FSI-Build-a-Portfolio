      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded

    <p class="believe">I <em>believe</em> this job will help change my life</p>

    <h3 class="abtMe">About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Being raised by an entrepeneur as a father and a talented athletic mother,
      I was always taught to the importance of structure, leadership, fluid
      communication and integrity. Mutual respect is earned and cooperation is
      formed when people not only work well together, but when they can also
      adapt to change and use all possible resources to get tasks done.
    </p>

    <p>
      I not only want to show my mindset, I want to become an asset to my
      employer while expanding my skills and becoming a talnted trustworthy
      software developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like many of my generation, my work history has been a variety of
      "get-er-done" jobs. Meaning I did what I had to do to pay rent and help my
      family recover from a recession that crippled our financial situation.
      Remember I said entrepeneur father; there are ups and downs, unfortunately
      our down was deep. Although we were down, we were never out. Our family
      worked together to develop moderately profitable start-ups, which
      unknowingly awakened a latent talent within myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      I loved tinkering, developing, creating and figuring complicated things
      out. This first led me to pursue a career in law/politics, but in a
      nutshell things didn't go well in that route. I was a bad student and soon
      lost passion for what I was doing. My true passion stemmed from art and
      creation. I would draw, create stories and dive so deep into gaming my
      friends and I would stay up for hours. To cut things short my life had
      many turns but working with my family I became the computer guy who
      created presentations, developed websites, collaborated on graphic
      designs, operated ecommerce sites and wore a plethora of hats when it came
      to "digital interactions". On top of being a huge fan of streaming media
      devices and working at a cell phone company I become even more interested
      in pursuing a career in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest turn in my life has led me moving from my home of 25 out of 34
      incredible years, Atlanta, GA to Virginia Beach, VA. The "get-er-dones"
      weren't getting it done and I needed a change. I hoped to get into the
      military contractor game and find a way into the STEM industry. Then Covid
      happened. To this day I believe I caught it in late fall 2019. Sickest I
      ever been! Covid led to a pivot, pointing me in the direction of a temp
      agency who got me into an IT Service Desk position.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work at Hexaware Technologies, a tech company that offers a
      wide array of services for pharmaceutical/health sciences industry. My
      current role has been IT Support Analyst.
